# whatthechhat
The idea of WhatTheChhat was born as a result of frustration and an inspiration. "Frustration", because of having heard and undergone the horrors of a house search (5 times in 3 years to be precise) and still being clueless on the way to go about finding the right accommodation. "Inspiration", as we knew that we could truly add value and cater to this inherent need.
Proposed system:
• The website provides PG, rental homes directory for real customers, and potential paying guests of the homes
• Search based on keywords such as location, prices
• Customized user accounts that can be dynamically generated
• Dynamic Content Updation
• Automated Email and SMS facilities
• Comparison of properties based on location (distance from nearest hospital, school, airport, railway station etc)
